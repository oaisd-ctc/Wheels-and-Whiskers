Hey! It's Hayden. 

This is my final class project that I'm calling "Wheels and Whiskers." It's a racing game with cats.

In Wheels and Whiskers, the idea is to get around the track in as little time as possible, while avoid hitting barriers that will slow you down. Your best time is shown!

I've uploaded this project to Itch.io, which may be showing off for a school project. Lol

The game does not look like that GIF. The GIF does look cool, however, and so I'm sharing it with you.
